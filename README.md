### Objectives
Overview of the Packet Tracer Program
<br>
### Background
Packet Tracer is a fun, take-home, flexible software program which will help you with your Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) studies. Packet Tracer allows you to experiment with network behavior, build network models, and ask "what if" questions.
<br>
In this activity, you will explore a relatively complex network that highlights a few of Packet Tracerâ€™s features. While doing so, you will learn how to access Help and the tutorials. You will learn how to switch between various modes and workspaces. You may need to adjust the window size of Packet Tracer to see the full network. If necessary, you can use the zoom in and out tools to adjust the size of the Packet Tracer window.
Note: It is not important that you understand everything you see and do in this activity. Feel free to explore the network on your own. If you wish to proceed more systematically, follow the steps below. Answer the questions to the best of your ability.
